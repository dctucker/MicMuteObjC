# MicMuteObjC
Command line script to mutes the default input device on Mac OS

Run this command to toggle the muted state of the default input device.
Useful with Karabiner or in an Automator Service to assign a system-wide hotkey.
Great for Skype, Hangouts, or other video conferencing tool.
You know, because nobody wants to hear you type, cough, sneeze, or emit violent outbursts due to project scope creep ;-)
